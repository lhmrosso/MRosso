Using R or Python programing languages I have developed simple tools to help farmers, agronomist, and researchers. Codes are available in [GitHub](https://github.com/lhmrosso) and please contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. The tools are listed below and linked to the blog posts in which they are hosted.  

SampID | Samples identification system and labels  
ExpMap | Experiment map and treatment randomization
