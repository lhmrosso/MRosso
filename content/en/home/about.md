&emsp;&emsp;On my familyâ€™s farm in northeast Brazil, I could early experience crop production and the major role agriculture plays in my country. The desire to better understand cropping systems took me to earn a B.S. degree in Agronomy from the [Federal University of Santa Maria](https://www.ufsm.br). Early in my academic career, I became involved in research activities related to soil fertility and precision agriculture. I found out a lot of questions we had no answers for and how the scientific method could help farmers with those problems. Aiming to learn more research tools and experience other agriculture scenarios I came to the [Kansas State University](https://www.k-state.edu) and am currently pursuing a M.S. degree in Agronomy. After completing my graduate program I wish to keep studying cropping systems and to spread research findings among the hard-working people involved in crop production. **Click here** to download a copy of my CV.

&emsp;&emsp;In this website you can learn more about research projects I am involved, see some field pictures I take along the way, read my blog posts, and use some simple tools I developed thru computer programing to help farmers and agronomists.
