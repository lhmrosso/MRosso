On my familyâ€™s farm in northeast Brazil, I could early experience crop production and the major role agriculture plays in my country. The desire to better understand cropping systems took me to earn a B.S. degree in Agronomy from the Federal University of Santa Maria. Early in my academic career, I became involved in research activities related to soil fertility and precision agriculture. I found out a lot of questions we had no answers for and the scientific method could help farmers with those problems. Aiming to learn more research tools and experience other agriculture scenarios I came to the Kansas State University and am currently pursuing a M.S. degree in Agronomy. After completing my graduate program I wish to keep studying cropping systems and to spread research findings among the hard-working people involved in crop production.
